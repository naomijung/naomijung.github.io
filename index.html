                        Hello! My name is Naomi Jung and I am a second-year undergraduate student 
                        studying Computer Science <!--and Political Economy--> at the University of California, 
                        Berkeley. I am an aspiring engineer and designer, and am particularly interested 
                        in the intersection between sustainability, social impact, and technology. In my 
                        free time, I enjoy exploring new places, hand-lettering, and dancing.

                                <p> RealtyShares is a real estate crowdfunding platform through which individual investors can purchase shares in vetted residential and commercial real estate properties for as little as $5,000. The company is backed by several investors including Union Square Ventures, 500 Startups, and General Catalyst.</p>
                                <p> During my internship, I designed, coded, tested, and deployed a full-stack Node-React web application that automated the validation of real estate track records submitted by borrowers. The web app parsed data from an uploaded Excel sheet and made corresponding calls to external API sources containing data from public record. The script compared this data to the input data and rendered an interactive message with the validation results.</p>
                                <p> In addition, I created a product roadmap for an internal admin tool that would help loan originators keep track of sponsor-submitted documents. I engaged with stakeholders, conducted user testing, and consulted with designers to break down the project and build stories and engineering tickets. </p>

We additionally researched and recommended messaging strategies to help the company enter these new markets successfully. The client has announced that they will expand to one of our recommended locations in early 2018.</p>  
                               <p> In the past, I also worked with a youth empowerment social enterprise that was working to develop a transitional employment pipeline program for opportunity youth. My team recommended best practices and external tools the organization could use to increase job attainment and retention upon program completion. The increased program efficacy as a result of our solutions is expected to lead to 100 additional youth being hired in Seattle by late 2017.</p>
